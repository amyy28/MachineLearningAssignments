## Current Progress

The code contains a hardcoded dataset and works for 4 epochs

### Things to be done
- Increase the dataset to minimum 100 values
- Increase the number of epochs

### As per directed by ma'am
The program should contain functions to
- Read the dataset from file = DONE
- Split the data into train and test. Ensure the data is split in the same way every time the program runs = DONE
- Initialise the weights of the perceptron, learning rate and epochs = DONE
- Define the activation function = DONE
- Train the model i.e. Learn the weights of the perceptron on the training data = DONE
- Print the learned weights and the hyperparameters (epoch and learning rate) = WILL DO
- Predict the outputs on train and test data = NOT SURE
- Print the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall on train and test data = TO BE DONE
