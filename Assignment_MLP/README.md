# Work Checklist

The program should contain functions to
- Read the dataset from file = DONE
- Split the data into train and test. Ensure the data is split in the same way every time the program runs = DONE
- Initialise the weights of the perceptron, learning rate and epochs = DONE
- Define the activation function = DONE
- Train the model i.e. Learn the weights of the perceptron on the training data = DONE
- Print the learned weights and the hyperparameters (epoch and learning rate) = DONE
- Predict the outputs on train and test data = DONE
- Print the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall on train and test data = DONE
- Increase the dataset to minimum 100 values = DONE
- Increase the number of epochs = DONE
